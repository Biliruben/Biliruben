				"effect": "\nYou’ve gone fishing, provided you are near a body of water. The project roll for this project has the following changes:\n\n* The points you roll represent the length of the fish (or fish-like creature) you catch.\n* During each respite when you undertake this activity, you continue making project rolls until you get an 11 or lower (fish got away, earning you no points) or a breakthrough.\n* A breakthrough results in rolling on the fishing events table instead of additional points or another project roll.\n\nWhen you finish rolling, you can spend the points you earned on a reward from the Tackle table. Any points you don’t spend during this respite activity are lost.\n\n| Reward                  | Cost | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|:------------------------|:-----|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hearty Meal (1 serving) | 50   | A serving of this meal gives the eater 1 additional Recovery that lasts until their next respite.
